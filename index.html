                <h3>Brief Intro</h3>
                <p>We know the popularity of uber and lyft in the recent years and about the urban citizens who are benefited by the uber. Later the author compares the difference between the competitive taxis and uber and defines new way of calling and also the new way of paying for cabs, the author also tells us about the importance of data produced by the cabs daily and also about the visualization and analysis of data. After that the author tells how the different time and different environments will have an effect on passengers to make different choices.

                    <br><br>After analyzing the different parameters, here are a few pointers that we can conclude. If you were a Business Analyst or a data scientist working for either Uber or Lyft, you could draw the following conclusions:
                    
                    <br> -> Uber is more economical; however, Lyft also provides fair competition.
                    <br> -> People prefer to have shared rides during the nighttime.
                    <br> -> People avoid taking rides when it rains.
                    <br> -> When traveling long distances, the price does not increase linearly. However, based on the time and demand, a surge can affect the cost.
                    <br> -> Uber can be the first choice for long distances.
                    <br>However, acquiring and analyzing similar data is only a tipping point for several companies. There are several enterprises in the market that can help bring data from multiple sources and in different formats into the data warehouse of your choice.</p>
